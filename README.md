🎯 Hangman Game
Welcome to the Hangman Game, a classic word-guessing game developed as part of the 100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp by Dr. Angela Yu.

This project was created to reinforce fundamental Python concepts such as string manipulation, loops, conditionals, functions, and basic data structures.

📌 Features
🧠 Random word selection from a pre-defined list

🔡 Letter-by-letter guessing

🖼️ Visual representation of hangman stages using ASCII art

❌ Lose condition after a number of incorrect guesses

✅ Win condition when all letters are guessed correctly

🔁 Option to replay after each game

🛠 Technologies Used
Python 3

ASCII Art for UI representation

Basic terminal I/O

🚀 Getting Started
